# AP-Module-Cpp-Wednesday-Exercises
This repo is part of my 'Advanced Programming' module. It contains all of my Wednesday tasks / challenges.

## Exercise 1: File Exists
A simple C++ program that allows the user to enter a filename. The program should display the file’s status, if the file exists include the file size and last modified date.

Example output:
```
Filename to check: data.csv
data.csv does not exist

--OR--

Filename to check: data.csv
data.csv, 25 bytes, last modified: Tue Jan 12 14:41:00 2021
```
## Exercise 2: File Writer
A simple C++ program that allows the user to enter a name. The program should append (or create in the first instance) a plain text file called “list.csv” with the name entered. Once updated, the user should be prompted to enter another name, if no additional names are expected the program should finish with a goodbye message.

Example output:
```
Enter name: Jaelynn Stuart
Updating file...

Add another (y/n)? Y

Enter name: John Smith
Updating file...

Add another (y/n)? N
Goodbye
```
