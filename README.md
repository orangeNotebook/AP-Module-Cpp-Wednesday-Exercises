# AP-Module-Cpp-Wednesday-Exercises
This repo is part of my 'Advanced Programming' module. It contains all of my Wednesday tasks / challenges.

## Exercise 1: File Exists
A simple C++ program that allows the user to enter a filename. The program should display the fileâ€™s status, if the file exists include the file size and last modified date.

Example output:
```
Filename to check: data.csv
data.csv does not exist

--OR--

Filename to check: data.csv
data.csv, 25 bytes, last modified: Tue Jan 12 14:41:00 2021
```
